#Ex. 22 - first problem with #break 

#Ex. 24  - Control the loop: it's 'break if' on line 6 not 'if break!'
#Ex. 25 - AGAIN, it's 'if break!
#Ex. 26 - The #times method. Need to review. Look at CA notes. 
# Exercise 91 

#An object in a string can be called a "substring"

#On line 3, puts is the cmmd, colors is the variable, 
#include? is the case-sensitive(!) method, and ('Yellow') is the ARGUMENT. 
#True is returned if the argument is ('ink)' b/c
# the string contains 'pink'

#Exercise 92 - nothing
#Exercise 93 - Should've been easier for me. Solved != tutor!
#..is an inclusive range, ... is an exclusive one. Double-check 
#Ex. 94 'Free the lizard'
#Ex. 95 'One Isn't Enough' The array outputted never appears on screen
#Ex. 96 - explains #each method. IMPORTANT 

#Ex. 102 - Arrays & Hashes are 'data structures' and probably not
# the only ones.
#When creating a hash using Strings as keys, keep in mind 
#you must use '' and => characters. 

#Ex.103 - if you repeat a key using hash#[]=, Ruby only replaces 
#the value of the key. It doesn't add it!  

#Ex. 107 What is enumerable#map? Tutor says will learn it later.
# Ex. 108 - Most important here is it's lesson on 2 variables referencing the same hash
#Ex. 110 - .

#Ex. 111 -
#Ex. 112 - 
#Ex. 113 - 
#Ex. 114 - aced! 
#Ex. 115 - Took too long! Forgot #push method, 2nd grammar wrong. 
#Ex. 116 - Konggi is very hard, several answers.

#Ex. 118 -
#Ex. 119- Colorful things, very complex code 
#Ex. 120- product on the 3rd line needs to = 1
#Ex. 121- Line 19 is wrong, line 20 is correct
