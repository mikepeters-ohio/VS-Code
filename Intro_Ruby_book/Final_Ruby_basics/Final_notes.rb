# Exercise 91 

#An object in a string can be called a "substring"

#On line 3, puts is the cmmd, colors is the variable, 
#include? is the case-sensitive(!) method, and ('Yellow') is the ARGUMENT. 
#True is returned if the argument is ('ink)' b/c
# the string contains 'pink'

#Exercise 92 - nothing
#Exercise 93 - Should've been easier for me. Solved != tutor!
#Ex. 94 'Free the lizard'
